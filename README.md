This is a shifting maze for a D&D campaign.
The idea is simple: players enter through the entrance, and the selected room will display its details (which I haven't added yet). If needed, I can also undo the shuffle.
The issue isn't major, but I’d like it solved anyway. If you select a room, shuffle a few times, and then hit undo, you'll notice that the newly selected room won’t highlight. That’s the part where I'm stuck
